 YUG_treaty_of_wartholz_desc: "Signed by the Kingdom of Serbia in 1919, the Treaty of Wartholz is a punitive agreement that establishes Serbia’s postwar relationship with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It limits the size of the Serbian Army to 35 thousand men, establishes a free trade area between the two states, and requires Serbia to relinquish all claims upon Austrian and Bulgarian territory."

 YUG_secret_rearmament: "Secret Rearmament"
 YUG_secret_rearmament_desc: "Serbia’s secret rearmament began almost immediately after the Treaty of Wartholz, but ramped up in intensity after the Republican Revolution.

 YUG_open_rearmament: "Open Rearmament"
 YUG_open_rearmament_desc: "The Treaty of Wartholz is dead, and the Serbian eagle spreads its wings once more. Equipment is being purchased, a new generation of pilots and officers are trained, and the nation mobilised in preparation for the restoration of Greater Serbia."

 YUG_scarred_nation_desc: "Serbia suffered more than any other country in the Weltkrieg. Entire towns were depopulated, the country looted, hundreds of thousands died - and the ordinary Serb believes it was their fault. After all, it was a Serb who shot Archduke Franz Ferdinand and thus sparked the conflict. Though the leaders of Serbia may hold irredentist ambitions, they will need to convince the people that this will not go the same way as last time."

 YUG_konspiracija_idea: "The Konspiracija"
 YUG_konspiracija_idea_desc: "The Konspiracija orchestrated the Republican Revolution of 1925 and thus considers itself entitled to dictate the foreign policy of the country - they wish to pursue Serbian irredentism and the destruction of Bulgaria.

 YUG_Petar_II_regency_desc: "Petar II Karađorđević is the sole child of the late Aleksandar II, the last King of Serbia before the Republican Revolution. Left without a father at the age of two, he was secured by Petar Živković before the revolutionaries found him and smuggled across the border - from there, the heir made it all the way to Canada. There, he fell under the tutelage of his uncle Prince Pavle - a cultured and easy-going bon vivant who inducted the future King into the lifestyle of British nobility.\n\nRestored to the throne, Petar arrived to an impoverished nation and has been turned into a puppet for the politicking of Živković and Ljotić - and yet, though he may still be young, his nation sees potential in him. Perhaps he can turn a page away from his father and reveal himself to be a 'modern monarch', one with a liberal, British-raised view of the world."

 YUG_country_intro_header: "The Serbian Republic"
 YUG_country_intro_content: "The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist, was the catalyst which caused the beginning of the Weltkrieg. Though Serbian forces fought valiantly and earned the world's respect by stalling the Central Powers advance for months, by late 1915 the entirety of the country ended up occupied. Divided into Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian occupation zones, Serbia was exploited and burned, its adversaries seeking to enact revenge upon what they saw as a barbaric regime. This only emboldened resistance in the territory, however, and things on both sides of the front changed by 1918. Austria-Hungary, pressured by its German allies, finally began peace talks, while the Serbian resistance in Corfu, seeing the pitiful state of the Entente, came to the conclusion that even a bitter peace is better than annexation. King Petar abdicated and his son took the throne as Aleksandar II, who signed the punitive Treaty of Wartholz in 1919 - it restored a rump Serbia in the Austro-Hungarian occupation zone, forever tied to the Austrian sphere of influence.\n\nAn emboldened socialist movement in Belgrade, inspired by the Russian and French revolutions, and the opposition of the People's Radical Party got Aleksandar II to respond harshly. Political life was suspended, the socialist movement banned, and a Royal Dictatorship ushered in to maintain order in the defeated nation. This act only inflamed tensions in the country by the end, however, and it boiled over to revolution in 1925. The military, organised into the Konspiracija secret society, made an act of defiance against their King and orchestrated an assassination of Aleksandar II on December 3rd, which led the Royal Dictatorship to its collapse. Prime Minister Vojislav Veljković, surrendered to the opposition, which proclaimed a Serbian Republic.\n\nAfter a brief diplomatic standoff, the provisional government of Ljubomir Stojanović recognised the Treaty of Wartholz, and Vienna recognised the Republican government in turn. Today, Serbia stands as a burning symbol of democracy in the Balkans - at least on the surface. In truth, however, while the government may proclaim heartwarming goals like peace, welfare and prosperity, nothing in the Serbian government happens without the approval of the Konspiracija. This military secret society, deliberately styled after the Black Hand, seeks one thing and one thing only - the liberation of all Serbs outside of the Republic's borders. Again in the shadows, another conspiracy lurks as well - the White Hand, led by Petar Živković, which waits for a chance to overthrow the Republican interregnum and restore the underage son of Aleksandar II.\n\nAs 1936 begins, Serbia is still, nominally, a client state of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but this grip grows looser by the second, and once it finally falls, all of Serbia's enemies may tremble."

 YUG_petar_ii: "Petar II"
 YUG_petar_ii_leader_desc: "The first and only child of Aleksandar II Karađorđević, the last King of Serbia before the "republican" interregnum, Petar II was only two years old when he was taken from the overrun Royal Palace and handed over to the hands of Petar Živković. The young heir to the throne was moved out of the country and ended up in Canada, where the loyalists of the Karađorđević dynasty gave him to Prince Pavle, first cousin of Aleksandar II and a friend of the British royal family. While the White Hand continued the fight in the fallen Kingdom, the Prince was given the task of raising his nephew.\n\nThus, Petar grew up in the relatively liberal environment of Canada. He spent his childhood attending balls, speaking in English, and caring little about the impoverished Balkan state he still claimed the throne of. Though his guardian taught him little in the way of statecraft, the Westminster system he witnessed imprinted deep upon him. Once the time came for the young King to return home, he brought this British thinking with him.\n\nPersonality-wise, Petar is impulsive, naive and a hopeless idealist. His imagination of the political situation rarely coincides with reality. Though his kingdom may pale in comparison to his childhood home, he nevertheless sees the well-being of his subjects as his duty, even at the expense of political capital. This makes the young King easy to play with for those with actual political acumen. Thus, even if Petar may have good ideas in his mind, he has always been a tool for those who hold real power, and likely always will be."

 YUG_milan_grol: "Milan Grol"
 YUG_milan_grol_leader_desc: "Born in 1876, Milan Grol received a multi-disciplinary education studying philosophy, literature, theatre and arts. After a stint in Paris, he returned to Serbia in 1902 as a teacher and a writer, frequently lambasting King Alexander I and the Obrenovic dynasty in the press. Around this time, he began to affiliate with the left, joining the Independent Radical Party. His career in theatre came to an end with the start of the Weltkrieg. He moved to Geneva during the conflict and began to rededicate his life towards his political writings and activism.\n\nThe end of the war would see Serbia occupied and humiliated. Grol returned to his homeland to see a devastated nation, and soon helped found the Serbian Republican party. Victory in the 1931 elections saw Grol assume the post of Prime Minister under Dragisa Vasic. As a consequence, he was seen as the natural successor to Vasic, and went on to win the Presidency. Carrying legacy of Ljubomir Stojanovic on his shoulders, Milan Grol and his party are now empowered to bring about the reforms they’ve dreamed of over the land."

 YUG_trifun_kaclerovic_leader_desc: "The "old man of the socialists", Trifun "Triša" Kaclerović was born in 1879 in the Serbian countryside and became involved in the socialist movement during his student years. In the leadup to the May Coup of 1903, he and his fellow students organised a protest against the increasingly absolute Aleksandar I Obrenović. He remained in opposition even after the king's assassination and the rise of the Karađorđevićs. Now a leading member of the Social Democratic Party, Kaclerović spent the years leading up to World War I fighting for labour rights, representing the workers in the Skupština and demanding rights for socialists.\n\nThe end of the Weltkrieg saw the socialist movement split. Some, radicalised by the Russian and French Revolutions, turned to violence. Others shunned themselves from the ideology entirely, or clung onto reformism even in the tense atmosphere of postwar Serbia. Kaclerović led his faction of the Social Democrats to the nascent Socialist Workers' Party, and commanded it for the following decades. A grand hegemon of the left, the SRP unites everyone from social democrats to open Syndicalists. Kaclerović stands at the top of it all - all of them can respect this elderly, collected founder of modern Serbian socialism."

 YUG_zivko_topalovic: "Živko Topalović"

 YUG_dragomir_vasic: "Dragomir Vasić"
 YUG_dragomir_vasic_leader_desc: "Dragomir "Dragiša" Vasić is the second President of the Serbian Republic, elected with the initiative of the Republican Party in 1931. Born in Morava in 1885, Vasić unfortunately happened to belong to the generation of Serbian men and women sent to die in the trenches of the Balkan Wars and the Weltkrieg. It was there, during the Second Balkan War, that Vasić the revolutionary began to develop — and Vasić the writer. His first real attempt, a short story titled "Pačko", depicts a Serbian soldier in the Battle of Bregalnica. Pitying a felled Bulgarian officer, he tries to give him a proper burial in no man's land, only to be shot by the enemy while erecting a wooden cross. This revolutionary fervour slowly lead to disillusion with the Karađorđević dynasty — especially after the Salonika Trial, as one of the members of the Black Hand executed was his cousin Ljubomir Vulović.\n\nAfter the war, Vasić returned to Serbia along the remaining exiles, pursued a legal career, and founded the newspaper "Progress". However, it was soon shut down and his lawyer's licence suspended by the Royal Dictatorship for defending communists. In reaction, he joined the Republican Party and became a member of its main board, a crucial member of the underground organisation - not only thanks to his literary skill, but also his numerous contacts within the Serbian Army. When the Revolution came, Vasić joined it, was elected to the Skupština, and accepted his role as the Ambassador to the Commune of France. While visiting Paris and seeing its achievements did not convert him to a Syndicalist, it nevertheless fascinated him.\n\nThe Konspiracija, suspicious of President Jaša Prodanović's anti-militarist stance, forced him out of power in 1931. Discreetly inviting Vasić to succeed him in the next election, they expected him to be easier to control thanks to his past in the Black Hand. Reluctantly, Vasić agreed, and stands today as a leader torn between his progressive outlook and his debt to the conspirators. To him, the fight against Bulgaria is not just a matter of irredentism - it is a matter of liberty. Time and time again the Serbs have proven to be its beacon in the Balkans while the Bulgarians dabble in dim absolutism. But can Serbia really claim to be a harbinger of liberty in this state?"

 YUG_milan_stojadinovic: "Milan Stojadinović"
 YUG_milan_stojadinovic_leader_desc: "Named after King Milan of Serbia, Milan Stojadinović was born to the family of a rural judge in Šumadija, and followed the same course as many in the Serbian intellectual class. A childhood friend of Živko Topalović, he sympathised with socialism in his youth, before pursuing national liberation over class struggle. Ending up in the People's Radical Party instead. Stojadinović spent the time before the Weltkrieg outside of Serbia, studying in Western universities and representing the Ministry of Finance abroad, and returned to his homeland just in time to serve in the Balkan Wars.\n\nThe Serbian exiles in Corfu, including Stojadinović, needed bureaucrats — men who would make sure that as few of their thinned ranks starve and wither away. Stojadinović, as a clerk in the Ministry of Finance, distinguished himself as a capable economist and negotiator, helping stabilise the Serbian dinar, raise funding for the remnants of the Army, and ensure distribution of the scarce resources. The Prime Minister and leader of the Radicals, Nikola Pašić, recognised his efforts, and Stojadinović became his protege. When Pašić was dismissed after the end of the war on Aleksandar II's orders, Stojadinović resigned as well. He returned to a modest and calm life as a banker and university professor.\n\nThe tide of the Republican Revolution caught Stojadinović as well, many saw him as a republican sympathiser. When Aca Stanojević invited him to the refounded Radical Party, he accepted. Years pass, the old generation of Radicals pass away, and the calm, collected and intelligent economist Stojadinović was the natural fit to lead them. The dilemma of unifying the South Slavs is on his mind, but so are the lessons passed down to him by his mentor: "When it comes to the grand design which God has for the Serbian nation, there can be no compromise or half-measures". Freedom is strong, but collective, absolute power can be stronger."

 YUG_petar_zivkovic: "Petar Živković"
 YUG_petar_zivkovic_leader_desc: "To his enemies, he is known as a deadly intricate webweaver, a nefarious puppetmaster who held Aleksandar II hostage and crafted the infamous Royal Dictatorship following the Weltkrieg. To his followers, he is known as the most loyal a monarchist could possibly be, a soldier who has stood by the House of Karađorđević as long as he lived. Petar Živković was born in 1879 and followed the prestigious career of military service. He rose to become a member of the Royal Guard, a position in which he played a crucial role during the events in 1903, as he was the guard who opened the entrance to the Royal Court and allowed the Black Hand to extinguish the House of Obrenović. Živković soon became disillusioned with the Black Hand, however, believing that their leader Apis was plotting to overthrow the Karađorđevićs as well. Following the advice of Crown Prince Aleksandar, Petar created the White Hand - a rival to the Black Hand, dedicated to the protection of the ruling dynasty.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, Živković disposed of his Black Hand rivals at last, sentencing Apis and his comrades to death in the Thessaloniki Process. Though Serbia lost the war, his power only continued to grow. It was his advice that Aleksandar followed when proclaiming the Obznana and declaring the Royal Dictatorship. Some even rumoured that he held the King's dirty secrets, forcing the monarch to dance to his will. Unfortunately, as powerful as he was, he could not predict, nor prevent, the Revolution. In the midst of the monarchy's collapse, he made sure to secure the two-year-old heir, Petar II, and place him in the hands of Prince Pavle in Canada. The White Hand transformed into a secret society, taking revenge on the Republican officers, sowing terror and plotting their return to power. Always more accustomed to court politics than terrorism, Živković despised this change, instead spending his time in exile coordinating his underlings. Waiting for the moment to return - until, someday, he can finally right the wrongs of the last decade."
